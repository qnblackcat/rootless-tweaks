### What is this?
- All tweaks in the release are open-source. I simply recompiled them so they can work on Dopamine jailbreak without using OldABI (also known as **Legacy arm64e Support**). 

- Note that there will be issue(s). Do not expect all tweaks/features to work perfectly.

- I'm not the dev, please don't ask me to fix issues.

### Developer: let me know if you don't like me distributing your work. I'll remove it immediately
